# DBDLeague Survivor Team Loadout Builder
This project aims to provide a way for DBDLeague teams to build their survivor loadouts without having to have the game launched to select perks, and only rely on talking about what everyone is thinking of running, as well as having to look at the tier and killer specific perk bans. 

Instead you will be able to use this one site to make all 4 loadouts at once.

All you'll have to do is choose which killer you're expecting to play against, and perks banned against them and their tier will be removed from the available options.
